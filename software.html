						<h4><a href="#">Computing Infrastructure</a></h4>
                        <p><b>Computing Infrastructure and Network</b></p>
						<p>&#8226; The internet and intranets are two distinct networking techniques that are used in diverse contexts. Their distinctions are as follows:
                        The internet is a global network of connected computers and servers that communicate with one another using the standard Internet Protocol (IP), whereas an intranet is a private network designed exclusively for use within a company or a small group of people.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, an intranet is a private network created specifically for use within a company or a certain group of people, whereas the internet is a global network that enables individuals and businesses to access and share information. The primary distinction between the two is that whereas an intranet is a closed network that only authorised users can access, the internet is a public network that is available to everyone.</p>
                        <p>&#8226; A network's logical or physical layout is referred to as its topology. There are numerous network topologies, each with unique benefits and drawbacks. Some of the most typical network topologies are: Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, and to make these networks work, various technologies and protocols are used, such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, TCP/IP and VPN</p>
                        <p>In summary, there are several network topologies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. To make these networks work, various technologies and protocols such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, TCP/IP, and VPN are used.</p>
                        <p>&#8226; The choice of a network architecture is influenced by a number of variables, including the network's size, the number of connected devices, and the desired level of security. It is crucial to take into account any potential network security vulnerabilities when choosing a topology.</p>
                        <p>A star topology is a good choice for small to medium-sized networks, but it is important to be aware of the cybersecurity threats associated with it. To mitigate these threats, it is essential to implement proper security measures such as firewalls, access controls, and encryption. Additionally, regular network monitoring and patching can help detect and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.</p>

						<p>&#8226; On the basis of its functionality and intended use, the software can be divided into various categories. Here are a few typical software categories: System software, Programming software, Web software and Gaming software.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, software can be divided into many groups according to its functionality and use. When choosing software as a tool for problem-solving in the workplace, it's crucial to take the organization's unique goals and requirements into account, as well as the software's features, user experience, compatibility, cost, and support.</p>
                        <p>&#8226; Software can be designed, developed, and tested in collaboration using a variety of software development approaches. Every methodology includes a unique set of procedures and guidelines that can be customised to meet the particular requirements of a project. Here are the four well-known software development techniques along with examples of how they might be used in the software development lifecycle: Waterfall Methodology; Agile Methodology; DevOps Methodology; Scrum Methodology</p>
                        <p>Software development approaches can be modified to meet the unique requirements of a project. The Scrum technique is an agile framework for software development, the DevOps methodology stresses communication between development and operations teams, the waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach, and the agile methodologies are iterative and incremental. Each technique has benefits and can be used to efficiently cooperate on software design, development, and testing.</p>
                        <p>&#8226; To guarantee that software is of high quality and complies with requirements, a variety of software validation and correctness approaches can be used. Popular ones include the following: Unit testing; Integration testing; System testing; Acceptance testing; and Automated testing</p>
                        <p>The selection of a methodology is based on both the stage of the software development process and the particular requirements of the software. Unit testing, for instance, is better suited for early phases of development, whereas system and acceptability testing are better suited for later phases. Additionally, a mix of approaches may be employed to guarantee that the programme is adequately tested and validated for accuracy.</p>

                        <p><b>System Software – Operating Systems</b></p>
						<p>&#8226; An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that controls the use of hardware and software resources on a computer and offers common services to software applications. The following are some of the main characteristics, tools, and capabilities of an OS: Process Management, File Management, Device Management, Security, User Interface, Networking, System Tools.</p>
                        <p>An OS is a crucial part of contemporary computing systems due to its many features, capabilities, and tools.</p>
                        <p>&#8226; The needs of the task, the hardware setup of the computer, and the preferences of the user all play a role in determining which operating system is best for a given task. Here are a few instances of operating systems that are appropriate for particular jobs: Windows: macOS; Linux; Android iOS</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, the operating system selection is based on the particular work at hand as well as the hardware setup of the computer or other device. It's crucial to assess the task's specifications and select an operating system that can deliver the required performance and features.</p>
                        <p>&#8226; A variety of file systems, storage devices, and input/output (I/O) protocols are supported by operating systems (OS) for data access and storage. Following are a few instances of how an OS might assist data access and storage:</p>
                        <p>Operating systems (OS) provide support for data storage and data access through various file systems, storage devices, and input/output (I/O) mechanisms. The specific features and mechanisms the OS provides depend on the specific OS and its configuration. However, OS generally provides a flexible and robust platform for storing and accessing data.</p>
